	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to a measure of how long an algorithm takes to run based on the size of its input data, and when describing an algorithm as efficient in terms of time complexity, it means that the algorithm has a low time complexity, indicating it will perform well even with large inputs, typically represented by a lower order of growth in Big O notation</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of its input, expressed using the Big O notation to indicate how the memory usage scales as the input grows. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. Space Complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though.</p>
